OPEN HTML TO PDF
---------

OVERVIEW
========
Open HTML to PDF is a pure-Java library for rendering arbitrary well-formed XML/XHTML (and even HTML5)
using CSS 2.1 for layout and formatting, outputting to PDF or images.

Use this library to generated nice looking PDF documents. But be aware that you can not throw modern HTML5+ at
this engine and expect a great result. You must special craft the HTML document for this library and 
use it's extended CSS feature like [#31](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/pull/31) or
[#32](https://github.com/danfickle/openhtmltopdf/pull/32) 
to get good results. Avoid floats near page breaks and use table layouts.
